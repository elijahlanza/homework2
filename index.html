    <p>
      I have spent the last several years working in the finance industry. My roles have been both client
      facing and back shop. I began working at Wells Fargo
      in 2013 in the credit card collections department. Within the first 15 months, I was able to move
      positions into the Research and Resolution department.
      It was in this department that I spent a majority of my time focusing on my writing skills. I would play a
      major role in helping to build the Wells Fargo resolution team.
      After 2 years I left the resolutions team and went to work within the Wells Fargo private bank. I would go
      on the work with some of the richest people in Utah and accross the country.
      Finally, this experience would lead me to the coding boot camp preparing for a new career as a developer
